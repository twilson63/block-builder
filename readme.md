# BlockBuilder

BlockBuilder is a fun tool that allows programmers to create voxel/cube structures by writing code!  Using JavaScript you can create mazes, buildings, and cities in a rich WebGL environment.  BlockBuilder uses the VoxelEngine as the canvas, all you need to know is some basic JavaScript commands to get started.  With BlockBuilder you can save and share your creations with other BlockBuilder users.  Fork creations from other users and build on top of them!

## Getting Started

Simply go to http://twilson63.github.io/blockbuilder and register with Persona, after you have registered, BlockBuilder will ask you for a handle.  The handle is a unique description for your user.  This is the description that will be used to reference your work.  

Once you have successfully registered now you can go to the editor and start creating your masterpiece!  

## About the Editor

The editor consists of two panels, the left panel is your code area and the right panel is the voxel world your creation will be placed in.  To initialize your voxel world, go ahead and click in the right panel, move around and make sure you have an empty world.  Next press `Esc` to un-focus the voxel panel and click on the left panel to start writing some code.  When you have your code complete, just press the Run button and you should see your structure appear in the voxel world!  Continue to work and press run every time you would like to  see the results.  When you are satisfied with your structure click `save` and a short code will be generated to name your work and store the code in your BlockBuilder account.  This short code can be referenced later to retrieve your work, edit or publish it to the gallery.
